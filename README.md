Assumptions and Solution Documentation for Password Generator Project

1. Project Structure
The project consists of two main directories:
 frontend  (React.js - Frontend)
 backend   (Node.js/Express.js - Backend)
The frontend is a React.js application for user interaction.
The backend is a Node.js/Express.js API that generates passwords.

2. Git and GitHub
A GitHub repository named Password-Generator exists at:
 https://github.com/Meghana-ts/Password-Generator.git
The repository was manually created without initializing it with a README or .gitignore (to avoid conflicts).
The entire project is managed under a single Git repository, rather than separate repositories for frontend and backend.
Git is installed and configured properly on the system.

3. .gitignore 
A single .gitignore file is present in the root directoryand applies to both frontend and backend.
This ensures that sensitive or unnecessary files are not pushed to GitHub.

4. Backend 
The backend is a simple Express.js server running on port 5000.
The API endpoint /generate-password:
Accepts query parameters (length, alphabets, numbers, symbols).
Generates a secure password based on the selected criteria.
Returns the password as a JSON response.
The backend uses CORS middleware to allow frontend access.
The dotenv package is used to manage environment variables.
The server is started using:  node server.js

5. Frontend
The frontend is a React.js application using:
Axios for API requests.
Framer Motion for animations.
React Icons for UI enhancements.

The frontend communicates with the backend via:
 http://localhost:5000/generate-password
 
It supports:
User-defined password length.
Options for alphabets, numbers, and symbols.
A copy-to-clipboard feature with animation.
A visually appealing UI with responsiveness.

7. Deployment 
Frontend Deployment: Hosted on Vercel or Netlify.
Backend Deployment: Hosted on Render, ensuring the API is publicly accessible.
Environment variables (.env file) are properly set up in deployment platforms.
CORS is enabled on the backend for smooth frontend communication.

Solution Steps: Setting Up and Pushing Code to GitHub

Step 1: Initialize Git Locally
Open Visual Studio Code, navigate to the project folder, and initialize Git:
git init  # Initialize Git
git branch -M main  # Rename branch to main


Step 2: Connect to GitHub Repository
Add the remote GitHub repository:
git remote add origin https://github.com/Meghana-ts/Password-Generator.git
git remote -v  # Verify the connection


Step 3: Add and Commit Files
Add all files to Git tracking and commit:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with frontend and backend"


Step 4: Push Code to GitHub
Push the code to GitHub:
git push -u origin main


Step 5: Verify on GitHub
Open GitHub repository.
Ensure both frontend/ and backend/ directories are visible.

Step 6: Start Backend Locally
Run the backend server:
cd backend
npm install  # Install dependencies
node server.js  # Start the server


Step 7: Start Frontend Locally
Run the frontend React app:
cd frontend
npm install  # Install dependencies
npm start  # Start the React app
